The Marketplace section allows users to view and configure the connectivity of various interfaces integrated with the Cloud applications, all of which can impact the operation and automation of your hotel.

This is the central area to manage official integrations with providers such as Channel Managers, and other available third-party systems.

On the main page, you’ll find a list of all the entities that can be configured for interface connectivity with your property.
